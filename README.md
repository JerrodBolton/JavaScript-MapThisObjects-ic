# In Class: JavaScript Map/This/More Objects

1. Use ```.map``` to take the code from the array below, and results in a new array where each value is 5 more than it was in the old array.

```
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var plus5 = [];
```

Print the new array.

2. Use ```.map``` to create a new array of objects where each object has a property for ```index``` and ```value``` based on the elements in the array ```let arr = [1,2,3,4];```.

Print the new array.

3. Write a function ```capitalize``` that takes a string and uses ```.map``` to return the same string in all caps. 

ex. ```capitalize('whoop') // => 'WHOOP'```
ex. ```capitalize('boy howdy!') // => "BOY HOWDY!"```

```
var capitalize = function(string){
  // code code code!
}
```
