# In Class: JavaScript Map/This/More Objects


1. Write a function capitalize that takes a string and uses ```.map``` to return the same string in all caps. 

ex. ```capitalize('whoop') // => 'WHOOP'```
ex. ```capitalize('boy howdy!') // => "BOY HOWDY!"```

```
var capitalize = function(string){
  // code code code!
}
```

2. Create a new empty array called ```pet_list```. Add 3 ```pet``` objects to the ```pet_list``` array (each ```pet``` should have a ```type``` and a ```breed property```) You can choose the pets.

* Add a new property called ```age``` to each pet instance in ```pet_list'''

* Assign a number for the ```age``` for all of the pets
